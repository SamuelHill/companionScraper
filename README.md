# companionScraper

Information scraping code written for the EECS 396 - Companion Studio class final project. This work is used to get faculty, events, and some background info like colleges, as well as to identify entities and topics of interest. All of the data is output in a symbolic form to be loaded into the Companions cognitive architecture, specifically to keep the QRG Kiosk aware of the updated information about our department kept online in various forms.

[meld scraper](./meld_scraper) contains the information scraping code for colleges, faculty, and events.

[entity and interests](./entity_and_interests) contains the code for identifying entities and topics of interest.
