["It is an irony that often the more severe a person's motor impairment, the more challenging it is for them to operate the very assistive machines which might enhance their quality of life. A primary aim of my lab is to address this confound by incorporating robotics autonomy and intelligence into assistive machines---turning the machine into a kind of robot, and offloading some of the control burden from the user to the machine. Robots already synthetically sense, act in and reason about the world, and these technologies can be leveraged to help bridge the gap left by sensory, motor or cognitive impairments in the users of assistive machines.", "My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, rehabilitation robotics and machine learning. A distinguishing theme present within many of my lab's projects is that the machine automation is customizable---to a user's physical abilities, personal preferences or even financial means. A fundamental question that arises time and again throughout many of our projects is how exactly to share control between the robot and the human user, and how to adapt these control formulations over time as the human changes. We are working with a range of hardware platforms, from a smart wheelchair to assistive robotic arms."]

[u"\xa0In the face of looming challenges like childhood obesity, environmental collapse, and soaring health care costs, we need dramatic and sustained innovation. The driving question behind my research is how technology and organizations can support the innovation process to solve these challenges. In particular, I examine what I define as collective innovation, an innovation process that harnesses the diverse and untapped human, social, and economic capital from distributed networks to discover, evaluate, and implement new ideas. \xa0Open, ubiquitous, sociotechnical systems support collective innovation affording greater speed and deeper and broader participation than was imaginable even a decade ago. While collective innovation is a new and exciting collaborative process that has the potential to massively transform society, it is poorly understood. I use grounded theory and design research (Easterday, Rees Lewis, and Gerber 2014) to establish theory and design principles and to develop infrastructure for collective innovation. My pioneering scholarship leads the academy's understanding of this fast-evolving, scalable infrastructure, and directly contributes to its improved functioning to benefit society at large.", u'\xa0The first premise of collective innovation is that direct collaboration between stakeholders can radically enhance rates of innovation (Gerber and Carroll, 2012; Gerber and Hui, 2013; Gerber, 2014). The second premise is that even across weakly connected, heterogeneous networks, changes in the design of our infrastructure can bring forth effort and resources that would otherwise lie fallow (Gerber, 2014; Shaw et al, 2014, Hui, Gerber, and Gergle, 2014; Gerber, 2007; Gerber, 2006). The third premise: Actively engaging a greater number and variety of people to participate in the innovation process expands the breadth of problems addressed and increases the quality of the solutions (Gerber, 2014; Gerber, 2007). This work is embodied in the three ongoing major endeavors of my career thus far at Northwestern: 1) Crowdfunding, 2) Digital Loft, and 3) Design for America.', u'\xa0My scholarship produces three types of results: 1) theory for collective innovation, 2) design principles, and 3) novel sociotechnical systems to support inclusive and continuous innovation in society. My work has resulted in 27 publications in the Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, Computer Human Interaction, and Management literatures and ACM Interactions and IEEE Internet Computing trade publications. My research has been highlighted in the press including the Wall Street Journal, Harvard Business Review, Wired, National Public Radio\u2019s Marketplace and generously and consistently supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance, Hastac (sponsored by the MacArthur and Mozilla Foundations), and Microsoft.\xa0', u'\xa0', "Professor Gerber's teaching interests include design, innovation management, and organizational behavior. At Northwestern she teaches undergraduate and graduate classes on product and service design which emphasizes the design thinking methodology - a human centered problem solving approach focused on gaining inspiration from human needs, working in diverse groups to generate ideas, and prototyping ideas for rapid feedback. She also advises students in the award winning design initiative she founded called Design for America where students take on extracurricular design work to make social and local impact."]

[u'I work on Computer Architecture, primarily on techniques to enable extreme-scale multi-core processors.

My research aims to pave the way to energy-efficient computing by investigating ideas to combat "dark silicon" (i.e., our inability to power up a chip in its entirety) and to speed up\xa0 the execution of programs by several factors through parallelism extraction and memoization at the software and hardware levels. Our work extends across multiple stacks: circuit design, processor architecture, memory systems, interconnects, compilers, runtime environments, and system software.', 'We develop technologies that allow the underlying hardware components to be unreliable, while maintaining program output quality, and in the process save energy. We develop technologies that eliminate the overheads of conventional computing, and turn the problem of dark silicon into an opportunity. We harness the unused chip area to build multiple heterogeneous pipelines within a core that deliver up to one order of magnitude higher power efficiency, and design novel energy-proportional nanophotonic interconnects to minimize the energy cost of data transfers at all levels, within a processor chip, across multiple chips, as well as across entire data centers. We believe that the confluence of parallel computer architeture techniques and nanophotonics will allow us to design "virtual macrochips" that can deliver supercomputing power at a fraction of the energy cost and area.']
