A primary aim of my lab is to address this confound by incorporating robotics autonomy and intelligence into assistive machines---turning the machine into a kind of robot, and offloading some of the control burden from the user to the machine. Robots already synthetically sense, act in and reason about the world, and these technologies can be leveraged to help bridge the gap left by sensory, motor or cognitive impairments in the users of assistive machines.My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, rehabilitation robotics and machine learning. A distinguishing theme present within many of my lab's projects is that the machine automation is customizable---to a user's physical abilities, personal preferences or even financial means. A fundamental question that arises time and again throughout many of our projects is how exactly to share control between the robot and the human user, and how to adapt these control formulations over time as the human changes. We are working with a range of hardware platforms, from a smart wheelchair to assistive robotic arms."}

Such designs are elusive due to technological limitations on yield, power, and memory bandwidth. My research aims to pave the way to energy-efficient computing by investigating ideas to combat \"dark silicon\" (i.e., our inability to power up a chip in its entirety) and to speed up  the execution of programs by several factors through parallelism extraction and memoization at the software and hardware levels. Our work extends across multiple stacks: circuit design, processor architecture, memory systems, interconnects, compilers, runtime environments, and system software.We develop technologies that allow the underlying hardware components to be unreliable, while maintaining program output quality, and in the process save energy. We develop technologies that eliminate the overheads of conventional computing, and turn the problem of dark silicon into an opportunity. We harness the unused chip area to build multiple heterogeneous pipelines within a core that deliver up to one order of magnitude higher power efficiency, and design novel energy-proportional nanophotonic interconnects to minimize the energy cost of data transfers at all levels, within a processor chip, across multiple chips, as well as across entire data centers.

My AI research focuses on control systems for autonomous agents: how does an agent decide from moment to moment what to do, based on an ongoing stream of sensor data and a continually varying set of goals and entanglements with the world.  My past work focused on robotics and computer vision, but my more recent work centers around the the modeling and simulation of emotion, personality, and social behavior for virtual characters for games and interactive narrative.  Interactive narrative is particularly interesting for AI because it provides a natural domain in which to examine aspects of human personality and behavior that one would not want to duplicate in service robots, such as aggression and depresssion.Within interactive art and entertainment, I'm interested in exploring alternative genres and interaction modes that can expand the medium.  Interactive narrative is particularly interesting because it offers the promise of an aesthetics that emphasizes experiences of identification, empathy, and affiliation, over mastery, frustration, and control.  However, making a piece that provides those experiences in practice is a difficult task that involves a number of interesting research problems in computer science and cognitive science."}

Electrical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL (1972)","B.S. Electrical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL (1971)"],"interests":"Since 1972, Prof. Taflove has pioneered theoretical approaches, algorithms, and applications of finite-difference time-domain computational solutions of the fundamental Maxwell's equations of classical electrodynamics.  In 1980, he coined the widely used descriptors \"finite difference time domain\" and \"FDTD\" (currently tallying more than 100,000 and 200,000 Google Scholar search results, respectively).  In 1990, he was the first person to be named a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in the FDTD area.  Subsequently, he was the recipient of the 2010 Chen-To Tai Distinguished Educator Award of the IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society, and the 2014 IEEE Electromagnetics Award. His citation for the latter reads:  \"For contributions to the development and application of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solutions of Maxwell's equations across the electromagnetic spectrum.\"  He is currently a Life Fellow of the IEEE and a Fellow of The Optical Society (OSA). His OSA Fellow citation reads: \"For creating the finite-difference time-domain method for the numerical solution of Maxwell's equations, with crucial application to the growth and current state of the field of photonics.\"FDTD solutions of Maxwell's equations have emerged as a primary means to solve the most complex scientific and engineering problems involving electromagnetic wave phenomena, devices, and systems across the spectrum, i.e., literally, from ultralow-frequency geophysical electrodynamic phenomena spanning the entirety of Planet Earth to visible light interacting at nanometer length scales with metamaterials and plasmonic structures.  In May 2010, Nature Milestones|Photons identified Prof. Taflove as one of the two principal pioneers of numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations.  In January 2015, in a Special Issue marking the 150th anniversary of the publication of Maxwell's equations, Nature Photonics prominently featured an interview with him dealing with FDTD's multi-decade development and its historical significance. In the interview's header, Nature Photonics identified Prof. Taflove as the \"father of the finite-difference time-domain technique.\"In Sept. 2012, Prof. Taflove's book, Computational Electrodynamics: The Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method was ranked as the 7th most-cited book in physics, according to the University of Rochester's Institute of Optics (ahead of books by three Nobel prize winners in physics).  At present, Taflove's book has 17,500 Google Scholar citations.Currently, continuing a collaboration that began in 2003, Prof. Taflove is working with Prof. Vadim Backman of Northwestern's Biomedical Engineering Department.  Their research is aimed at the minimally invasive, early-stage detection of deadly cancers such as those of the colon, pancreas, lungs, and ovaries.  The techniques being pursued are based upon spectral analysis of light that is backscattered from histologically normal tissue located away from a neoplastic lesion in what has been termed the field effect.  This may lead to a new paradigm in cancer screening where, for example, early-stage lung cancer could be reliably detected by analyzing a few cells brushed from the interior surface of a person's cheek."}
