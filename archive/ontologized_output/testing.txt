	["It is an irony that often the more severe a person's motor impairment, the more challenging it is for them to operate the very assistive machines which might enhance their quality of life. A primary aim of my lab is to address this confound by incorporating robotics autonomy and intelligence into assistive machines---turning the machine into a kind of robot, and offloading some of the control burden from the user to the machine. Robots already synthetically sense, act in and reason about the world, and these technologies can be leveraged to help bridge the gap left by sensory, motor or cognitive impairments in the users of assistive machines.", "My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, rehabilitation robotics and machine learning. A distinguishing theme present within many of my lab's projects is that the machine automation is customizable---to a user's physical abilities, personal preferences or even financial means. A fundamental question that arises time and again throughout many of our projects is how exactly to share control between the robot and the human user, and how to adapt these control formulations over time as the human changes. We are working with a range of hardware platforms, from a smart wheelchair to assistive robotic arms."]

	[u'I work on Computer Architecture, primarily on techniques to enable extreme-scale multi-core processors. Such designs are elusive due to technological limitations on yield, power, and memory bandwidth. My research aims to pave the way to energy-efficient computing by investigating ideas to combat "dark silicon" (i.e., our inability to power up a chip in its entirety) and to speed up\xa0 the execution of programs by several factors through parallelism extraction and memoization at the software and hardware levels. Our work extends across multiple stacks: circuit design, processor architecture, memory systems, interconnects, compilers, runtime environments, and system software.', 'We develop technologies that allow the underlying hardware components to be unreliable, while maintaining program output quality, and in the process save energy. We develop technologies that eliminate the overheads of conventional computing, and turn the problem of dark silicon into an opportunity. We harness the unused chip area to build multiple heterogeneous pipelines within a core that deliver up to one order of magnitude higher power efficiency, and design novel energy-proportional nanophotonic interconnects to minimize the energy cost of data transfers at all levels, within a processor chip, across multiple chips, as well as across entire data centers. We believe that the confluence of parallel computer architeture techniques and nanophotonics will allow us to design "virtual macrochips" that can deliver supercomputing power at a fraction of the energy cost and area.']

His citation for the latter reads:\xa0 "For contributions to the development and application of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solutions of Maxwell\'s equations across the electromagnetic spectrum."\xa0 He is currently a Life Fellow of the IEEE and a Fellow of The Optical Society (OSA). His OSA Fellow citation reads: "For creating the finite-difference time-domain method for the numerical solution of Maxwell\'s equations, with crucial application to the growth and current state of the field of photonics."', u"FDTD solutions of Maxwell's equations have emerged as a primary means to solve the most complex scientific and engineering problems involving electromagnetic wave phenomena, devices, and systems across the spectrum, i.e., literally, from ultralow-frequency geophysical electrodynamic phenomena spanning the entirety of Planet Earth to visible light interacting at nanometer length scales with metamaterials and plasmonic structures.\xa0 In May 2010, ", 'Nature Milestones|Photons', u" identified Prof. Taflove as one of the two principal pioneers of numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations. \xa0In January 2015, in a Special Issue marking the 150th anniversary of the publication of Maxwell's equations,", ' Nature Photonics', " prominently featured an interview with him dealing with FDTD's multi-decade development and its historical significance.
